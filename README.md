# Flying Tower
Open source roguelike dungeon crawler that uses ES6 features

Currently in **Alpha** state (Not Playable in any capacity of the word)
## Motivations
- To make and *finish* a roguelike game
- To learn ES6 features by practice
- To create code examples for how to use ES6 features, escpecially with JS games
## Special Thanks
- [ondras](https://github.com/ondras) for the Rot.js library
- [Larkenx](https://github.com/Larkenx) whose project inspired me to attempt to make my own JS roguelike using ES6.
- Jean-Pierre Sierens, for his [tutorial](http://jpsierens.com/use-es6-right-now/) that helped me setup the project.
- The many developers who work on the dependencies used in this project.
